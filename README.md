### Generation Modes



#### Together Mode## How It Works

- Generates tracker data **within the main AI response**

- Cleaner, single-generation approachInstead of having the AI model generate RPG companion data in its main response, this extension:

- Data automatically extracted and formatted in the sidebar

- Best for: Users who want seamless integration without extra API calls1. Lets you roleplay normally without RPG prompts cluttering the conversation

2. After each AI response, automatically sends a separate request to the model

#### Separate Mode3. Includes only the last few messages (configurable) for context

- Generates tracker data in a **separate API call** after the main response4. Asks the model to generate ONLY the RPG companion data

- Main roleplay stays clean without tracker formatting5. Displays the formatted data in a dedicated panel

- Contextual summary injected for immersive storytelling

- Best for: Users who want pure roleplay responses and don't mind extra API callsThis approach:

- ‚úÖ Keeps your main roleplay clean and focused

### Smart Features- ‚úÖ Reduces token usage in the main conversation

- **üîÑ Swipe Detection**: Automatically handles swipes and maintains correct tracker context- ‚úÖ Allows the model to focus on roleplay quality

- **üìù Context-Aware**: Weather, stats, and character states naturally influence the narrative- ‚úÖ Provides a better visual presentation of stats and info

- **üé≠ Multiple Characters**: Tracks thoughts and relationships for all present characters

- **üìç Thought Bubbles in Chat**: Optional floating thought bubbles positioned next to character avatars## Settings

### Generation Modes Explained

## Tips

#### Together Mode

```1. **Context Messages**: Start with 4 messages and adjust based on your needs. More messages = better context but slower updates

User: *walks into the tavern*2. **Performance**: If updates are slow, consider reducing the context depth or using a faster model

AI: [Full roleplay response]3. **Customization**: You can modify the prompts in `index.js` to add your own stat categories or change the format

```
